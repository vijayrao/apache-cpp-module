	*  Modified the build to be more flexible in lieu of various 
 	   linux distributions putting apache includes
           in a special place.  Also properly sniff out libtoolize->glibtoolize

	*  Made additional changes to support win32.  The code and dso work
	   should be complete, but the dsp project file has lots of hardcoded
	   paths.  Until I am able to get a win32 build machine up I will check
	   this in and request that it be made more generic.

	*  Change the dso work to use apr instead of direct calls to dlopen.  This
	   will help with the porting effort.

	*  Added enviroment decode class to decode request parameters.
           Handles both get and post requests, and also features
           cpp streams output support.  Modified examples/handler/test_handler.cpp
           to show an example of the classes in use.
           Also added a few include gards in header files,
           and created a dontdiff file to allow easier creation of patches.
