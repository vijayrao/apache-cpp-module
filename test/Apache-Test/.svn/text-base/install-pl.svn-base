# Apache/testold.pm in mod_perl 1.28, we need to find and remove any
# occurrences of this file. CPAN authors should
# s/Apache::test/Apache::testold/ and can either require mod_perl 1.28
# which already carries it or simply bundle it. The best option is to
# port the test suite to use Apache::Test which works with both
# mod_perl generations.

# we could have done this cleanup only for case-insensitive systems,
# but I feel that doing it for all systems, will speedup the
# transitions from Apache::test to either Apache::Test or
# Apache::testold.
