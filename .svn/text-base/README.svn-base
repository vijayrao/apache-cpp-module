mod_cplusplus is a proper apache module which allows you to load cpp objects 
as handlers for Apache-2.0.  It differs from other modules i've seen in that 
it manages the loading and calling of separate shared objects containing your
handler classes.  This allows you to easily and cleanly run an entire site
with c++ handlers.

Simply subclass from ApacheHandler and implement whichever methods you are interested in:

    virtual int handler()
    virtual int fixups()
    virtual int post_read_request() 
    virtual int translate_name() 
    virtual int header_parser()
    virtual int check_user_id()
    virtual int access_checker()
    virtual int auth_checker()
    virtual int type_checker()
    virtual int logger()

there is also a built in utility to fetch config directives (passed using 
PassCPPVar directive):
    char *get_cpp_var(r, name)

You only need to override the methods you want to handle for the given object, 
otherwise that phase will be declined.
